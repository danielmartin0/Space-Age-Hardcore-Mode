rocs-hardcore-gleba-cargo-drops-need-research=Players and construction bots are exempted.
rocs-hardcore-gleba-push-back-heating-tower=The heating tower technology requires automation, logistic, chemical and agricultural science packs. As with other Space Age: Hard Mode mods, this incentivizes a small science build prior to launching a rocket.
rocs-hardcore-gleba-move-forward-coal-synthesis=In vanilla, coal synthesis is unlocked by the Rocket Turret technology. However, it is usable earlier to create handheld rocket launchers on Gleba. This setting moves the coal synthesis recipe forward to be unlocked at the same time as the recipe to produce carbon from burnt spoilage.
