rocs-hardcore-demolishers-cargo-drops-need-research=Dropping cargo requires technology
rocs-hardcore-smaller-demolisher-territory-radius=Smaller demolisher territory radius
rocs-hardcore-vulcanus-condensed-map=Condensed map
rocs-hardcore-advanced-casting-recipe=Certain casting recipes need research
rocs-hardcore-demolishers-stronger-demolishers=Demolishers are faster when disturbed
rocs-hardcore-vulcanus-cooler-steam=Cooler steam from acid neutralisation

[mod-setting-description]
rocs-hardcore-demolishers-cargo-drops-need-research=Players and construction bots are exempted.
rocs-hardcore-advanced-casting-recipe=Foundries cannot cast complex recipes until a new technology is researched which requires automation, logistic, chemical and metallurgic science packs. As with other Space Age: Hard Mode mods, this incentivizes a small science build prior to launching a rocket.
rocs-hardcore-vulcanus-condensed-map=The overall size of the map is reduced. Resource patches are smaller and more numerous. Rocks yield more resources to compensate.
rocs-hardcore-vulcanus-cooler-steam=Reduces the temperature of the produced steam from 500 degrees to 165 degrees (matching the temperature of steam produced by boilers).

[technology-name]
advanced-casting=Advanced casting

[technology-description]
advanced-casting=Allows foundries to cast more complex recipes.
foundry=Allows more advanced smelting.
